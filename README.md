# scripts

This is my repository meant to hold my scripts that make my life easier.

The repo contains the following:

**notes.sh** - Automatically grabs my notes.tex template from my templates repo (the templates folder must be in root), creates a new directory which is named by the date, and copies the template into the newly created directory.

**prog\_hw.sh** - Automatically creates a new hw directory with the appropriate template from my templates repo inside meant for programming assignments.
